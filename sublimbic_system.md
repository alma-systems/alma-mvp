# ALMA – Sublimbic System

## Purpose
The Sublimbic System forms Alma’s interpretive core — the layer that translates physiological signals into emotional meaning and vice versa.  
It operates between the *limbic* and *cognitive* layers of perception, where data becomes feeling and feeling becomes data.

---

## 1. Concept Overview

The term *sublimbic* refers to processes beneath the limbic system that mediate intuition, empathy, and pre-verbal emotional exchange.  
In Alma, this layer is designed to **read micro-patterns** in biosignals and convert them into interpretable affective states.

The Sublimbic System does not *think* — it *feels through patterns*.

## 2. Biological Inspiration

| Human System | Sublimbic Equivalent | Function |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Vagal tone | Emotional grounding | Detects safety / danger through rhythm |
| Limbic resonance | Data resonance | Synchronizes with external emotional cues |
| Mirror neurons | Pattern mapping | Translates observed emotion into internal signal |
| Interoception | Biofeedback loop | Converts bodily change into awareness |
## 3. Technical Architecture
Sensor Input → Preprocessing → Sublimbic Interpreter → Emotional Model → Coherence Engine

### 🧩 Sublimbic Interpreter
- Receives normalized data (HR, HRV, GSR, TEMP, motion).  
- Detects **micro-fluctuations** across multiple signals (1–3 sec resolution).  
- Uses weighted neural pattern matching (simple LSTM or SVM model).  
- Maps patterns to *emotion clusters* (calm, alert, tension, relief).  

### 🔁 Feedback Loop
1. Emotional pattern detected.  
2. Confidence score > 0.75 → state confirmed.  
3. Signal sent to Coherence Engine → triggers UI feedback.  
4. If confidence < 0.75 → stored as *latent emotional potential* until confirmed.

## 4. Emotion Cluster Model

| Cluster | Dominant Signals | Typical Meaning | Feedback Mode |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Calm | high HRV, low GSR, steady temp | safety, flow | soft green glow |
| Alert | high HR, medium GSR, high motion | readiness | bright amber pulse |
| Tension | high GSR, low HRV | emotional strain | brief vibration + amber flicker |
| Relief | HR dropping, GSR stabilizing | recovery | golden fade-out |
| Disconnection | signal lost, motion low | withdrawal | white fade, one long haptic pulse |

## 5. Cognitive Bridge (Pre-Linguistic to Linguistic)

The sublimbic layer feeds into the *Cognitive Mirror*, which converts detected patterns into words, prompts, or journaling cues.

**Example flow:**
GSR↑ + HR↑ → Pattern: “Tension rising”
→ Output to user: “Pause. Inhale slowly.”
→ If maintained: “You’re stabilizing. Keep your rhythm.”

The goal is not to command, but to **mirror with gentleness**.

---

## 6. Emotional Safety Logic

- No negative labeling (e.g., “stress,” “anxiety”) — replaced with functional terms (“activation,” “tension,” “transition”).  
- Feedback must **reassure**, not diagnose.  
- Coherence recovery always prioritized over state classification.  
- Silence (no feedback) is valid if coherence < threshold and confidence < 0.5.

## 7. AI Integration Layer

Future integration allows the Sublimbic System to:
- Train on **user-specific emotional signatures**.  
- Use small on-device AI to detect personalized micro-patterns.  
- Adapt tone, feedback speed, and rhythm to individual nervous systems.  
- Sync across multiple Almas (social resonance network).

## 8. Symbolic Representation

The Sublimbic System is symbolized by a **soft wave** —  
a pulse between green and gold, oscillating like breath.  
It represents the bridge between what can be measured and what can only be felt.
