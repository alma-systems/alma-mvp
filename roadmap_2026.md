# ALMA – 2026 Roadmap

## Purpose
To provide a clear and structured roadmap for the continued development, testing, and deployment of Alma — the Emotional Resonance System.

---

## 1. Vision for 2026
Alma evolves from a prototype into a validated emotional interface — bridging measurable physiological data with felt human experience.  
The focus is on reliability, usability, and integration with broader well-being ecosystems.
