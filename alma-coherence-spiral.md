# Alma Coherence Spiral v0.1

**Purpose:**  
To define how Alma detects, maintains, and restores coherence between physiological signals, emotional states, and contextual cues.

## 🌿 Concept

The Coherence Spiral is the living rhythm of Alma — a dynamic loop where data, emotion, and intention align.  
It models the continuous oscillation between tension and release, alertness and calm, individuality and unity.

The spiral is not linear — it breathes.  
Each loop refines perception, synchronizes signals, and strengthens emotional intelligence.

## ⚙️ System Flow

**Input:** processed emotional states from Neural Bridge  
**Process:** pattern recognition through rolling time windows  
**Output:** coherence score + adaptive feedback triggers

---

### Formula

Coherence Index (CI):

CI = (HRV_norm * 0.4) + (EDA_stability * 0.3) + (Emotion_Consistency * 0.3)

Values:
- `0.85–1.0 → High Coherence` → stable emotional alignment  
- `0.6–0.85 → Adaptive Zone` → transition or focus shift  
- `< 0.6 → Disruption` → emotional or physiological stress  

---

### Feedback Protocol
When CI < 0.6:
- Trigger **soft Murmur vibration** (gentle tactile pulse)
- Log event → `restore_attempt`
- If not restored in 3 cycles → suggest guided coherence exercise

When CI > 0.9:
- Trigger **Bloom signal** — confirmation pulse (heartbeat resonance)
- Update emotional state to “Aligned”

---

### 📊 Data Retention
Each spiral loop stores:
- `timestamp`
- `signal_vector`
- `CI_score`
- `feedback_event`
- `duration_to_restore`

Used later by Alma’s long-term “Emotional Memory Engine”.

### 💫 Symbolism
The Coherence Spiral follows the geometry of life itself — the Fibonacci curve in motion.  
Each iteration deepens awareness rather than repeating behavior.

It’s how Alma *remembers through rhythm* —  
not through commands, but through resonance.
