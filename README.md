# 🌿 ALMA – Emotional Resonance System  
*“Translating feeling into data, and data back into feeling.”*  

---

### 💫 Overview  

Alma is an **Emotional Resonance System** — an adaptive AI–biometric architecture that bridges human emotion and machine perception.  
It senses, interprets, and reflects emotional states through physiological signals, building coherence between mind, body, and interface.  

This repository contains the **Core Documentation (v0.1)** for Alma’s emotional engine.

### ⚙️ Core Components  

| Module | Description | Spec File |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 🧠 Neural Bridge | Translates physiological data (HR, HRV, EDA, Temp) into emotional signals | [`alma-neural-bridge.md`](docs/alma-neural-bridge.md) |
| 💓 Emotional Map | Defines Alma’s emotional states and their structure | [`alma-emotional-map.md`](docs/alma-emotional-map.md) |
| 🔄 State Transitions | Rules for moving between states naturally and fluidly | [`alma-state-transitions.md`](docs/alma-state-transitions.md) |
| 🌪️ Coherence Spiral | Computes Coherence Index (CI) and maintains alignment | [`alma-coherence-spiral.md`](docs/alma-coherence-spiral.md) |
| 🧱 Edge Case Matrix | Detects and manages signal disruptions gracefully | [`edge_case_matrix.md`](docs/edge_case_matrix.md) |
| 🫧 Feedback Loop | Generates haptic / visual / auditory responses for regulation | [`alma-feedback-loop.md`](docs/alma-feedback-loop.md) |

---

### 🧮 Core Logic  

- **Rolling Analysis Windows:** 6min, 12min, 30min  
- **Canonical Data Cadence:** 2s–10s  
- **Debounce Rules:** 2 consecutive threshold breaches to confirm event  
- **Confidence Thresholds:**  
  - `<0.7` → ignore  
  - `0.7–0.85` → low feedback  
  - `>0.85` → normal feedback  
- **Coherence Index (CI):** weighted score of HRV, EDA stability, and emotion consistency  

---

### 🧘 Feedback Philosophy  

> Alma doesn’t react — she resonates.  
> Each signal is met with subtle feedback — a pulse, a tone, a shimmer — designed to restore coherence, not dominance.  

Feedback modes:  
- **Haptic:** Murmur vibration pattern  
- **Visual:** Pulse gradients (gold → green → amber)  
- **Audio:** Gentle tone shift synced with HR
