# Alma State Transitions v0.1

**Purpose:**  
To define how Alma shifts between emotional states in a fluid, natural way — mirroring biological regulation (autonomic balance) and cognitive-emotional coherence.

---

## 🌿 Core Principle
Transitions are *non-linear and dynamic*. Alma doesn’t jump instantly between emotions — it glides, recalibrates, and stabilizes.

Each transition has:
- **Trigger (input):** biometric or contextual signal  
- **Threshold:** how strong or sustained the trigger must be  
- **Transition phase:** recalibration stage (HRV & EDA stabilization)  
- **Target state:** the emotional mode Alma aligns with  
- **Recovery loop:** path to homeostasis

## 🌀 Primary Transition Paths

| From State | To State | Trigger | Physiological Signature | Cognitive Shift |
|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Calm | Focus | Increased attention or curiosity | Slight HR rise, EDA steady | Narrowed perception, goal orientation |
| Focus | Overwhelm | Sustained cognitive load | HR rise + EDA spikes | Fragmented attention, tension |
| Overwhelm | Recover | Rest or tactile reassurance | HR drop, EDA slow recovery | Relaxed awareness, safety perception |
| Recover | Calm | Stable HRV, low stress signals | Parasympathetic dominance | Coherent breathing, readiness |

## 🔁 Secondary Transitions
- **Joy ↔ Calm:** reward loop regulation  
- **Sadness → Reflection:** parasympathetic pivot  
- **Fear → Grounding:** vagal activation via tactile feedback  
- **Anger → Expression:** motion + vocal energy release

## ⚙️ System Integration
Each transition event emits:
- `state_change_id`
- `previous_state`
- `new_state`
- `confidence_score`
- `recovery_time_estimate`

Data is logged in Alma’s `coherence_spiral` engine for adaptive learning.
