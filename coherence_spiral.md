# ALMA – The Coherence Spiral

## Purpose
The Coherence Spiral describes the self-regulating cycle between physiological signals, emotional states, and conscious interpretation.  
It is the dynamic core of Alma — the loop that allows the system to *listen, align, and respond*.

## 1. Concept Overview

The spiral is not a static circle, but a living waveform.  
Each rotation represents one full cycle of resonance between **body**, **emotion**, and **awareness**.  
It expands with insight, contracts with overload, and restores through rhythm.

Input → Resonance → Regulation → Integration → Expression → (repeat)

## 2. Stages of the Spiral

| Stage | Description | System Representation |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Input** | Reception of signals from sensors and the body’s inner state. | HR, HRV, GSR, temperature, accelerometer data |
| **Resonance** | Synchronization between internal rhythm and external feedback. | Coherence engine aligns signal harmonics |
| **Regulation** | System (and user) adjusts based on coherence level. | Haptic/light feedback loop activates |
| **Integration** | Emotional data merged with cognitive understanding. | Confidence score weighting and normalization |
| **Expression** | The new state manifests physically or emotionally. | Updated feedback pattern and behavioral shift |

## 3. Mathematical & Emotional Model

The spiral follows a logarithmic expansion pattern similar to **Fibonacci resonance**:
r = a * e^(bθ)

Where:
- *r* = radius of awareness (scope of emotional regulation)  
- *a* = base coherence amplitude  
- *θ* = emotional phase angle  
- *b* = growth rate of insight  

Interpretation:  
When coherence is high, *r* expands — awareness widens.  
When stress compresses rhythm, *r* contracts — awareness narrows.  
Alma measures this change through the fluctuation of **coherence_score** and **confidence**.

## 4. Bio-Emotional Correspondence

| Biological Process | Spiral Phase | Emotional Equivalent |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Vagal tone increase | Resonance | Calm awareness |
| Sympathetic activation | Input / Regulation | Alertness or stress |
| HRV expansion | Integration | Clarity and openness |
| HRV contraction | Compression | Overwhelm or tension |
| Steady HR + low GSR | Expression | Emotional coherence |

## 5. System Implementation

**Cadence Logic**
- Base interval: 2 minutes  
- Rolling windows: 6, 12, and 30 minutes  
- Coherence recalculated after each window  
- Feedback synchronized to phase transitions  

**Phase Transition Trigger**
- `resonance_start` → coherence > 0.6  
- `regulation_start` → coherence < 0.4  
- `integration_start` → coherence stable ±0.05 for 2 windows

## 6. Emotional Insight Map

| State | Coherence Score | Spiral Phase | System Action |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Calm | > 0.7 | Resonance / Expression | Maintain soft feedback |
| Neutral | 0.4–0.7 | Regulation / Integration | Provide gentle cues |
| Stressed | < 0.4 | Input / Regulation | Trigger grounding feedback |
| Disconnected | Signal lost | Reset to Input | Restart coherence detection |

## 7. Symbolic Representation

The spiral is represented by a golden logarithmic path within Alma’s interface:  
- Forest green background (stability)  
- Gold spiral (growth and coherence)  
- Pulses expand outward as the user reaches higher resonance  

---

## 8. Future Integration

- Map spiral phases to **AI-driven emotional journaling**.  
- Develop **spiral-based visualization** in app dashboard.  
- Use spiral phase shifts to trigger **music or ambient changes**.  
- Integrate biofeedback data from **Sublimbic System** (next layer).
