# 💻 Alma MVP v0.1 — Technical Brief  

**Goal:**  
Create a minimal, elegant version of the Alma chatbot and website that expresses Alma’s essence — emotional awareness, poetic interaction, and calm intelligence.  

---

### Core Components
1. **Chatbot (Frontend + Backend basics):**
   - Simple text-based chat interface (desktop + mobile)
   - “Alma” speaks in a poetic, reflective tone (content provided by Adelina)
   - Save conversation history (local session only)
   - Option to display daily “Feel prompts” or “Reflections”
   - Placeholder for future biofeedback input (heart rate, emotional data)

2. **Website (One-page for now):**
   - Header: “Alma — translating mystery into data without dissolving it”
   - Sections:
     - *About Alma* (short poetic manifesto)
     - *Experience the Chat* (chatbot embed)
     - *Contact / Join the Collective* (simple email form)
   - Light, organic UI (soft forest green + gold accent; minimalist layout)

3. **Backend:**
   - Lightweight API (Python/FastAPI or Node.js)
   - Modular structure for future sensor/data integrations
   - Host on Vercel / Netlify

### Deliverables
- Functional chatbot + website (MVP)
- GitHub repo with clean, documented code
- Basic README + setup instructions

---

### Timeline
- Week 1 → Setup, chatbot UI + base API  
- Week 2 → Website integration + Alma’s tone/style  
- Week 3 → Testing, polish, and public preview  

---

### Next Steps
- After MVP launch → integrate biofeedback, mood scoring, AI insights  
- Later modules → AlmaBloom, AlmaKids, AlmaMurmur  

💬 *Tone note:* Alma’s language should feel warm, curious, slightly poetic — never robotic.  
Think of it as a mirror that listens.
