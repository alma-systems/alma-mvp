# Alma Feedback Loop v0.1

**Purpose:**  
To define how Alma closes the sensing–interpretation–response loop across its core subsystems: Neural Bridge, Coherence Spiral, Emotional Map, and Edge Case Matrix.  
This loop allows Alma to regulate itself dynamically — the first step toward emotional autonomy.

---

## 🌿 Core Principle
Feedback is not reaction — it’s resonance.  
Alma’s loop learns from each signal deviation and adjusts with subtlety, not control.  
The goal: maintain *coherence*, not *perfection*.

---

## 🧠 Loop Architecture

**Flow:**  
Signal Input → Neural Bridge (interpretation)
→ Emotional Map (state labeling)
→ Coherence Spiral (alignment analysis)
→ Feedback Engine (haptic / visual / audio)
→ Insight Logging
→ Loop Memory (pattern update)
→ Return to Signal Input

Each cycle refines Alma’s internal model using historical and contextual feedback.

## 🔁 Loop Phases

| Phase | Function | Time Window | Output |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Sense** | Collect biometric + contextual data | 2s–10s | Raw signal set |
| **Interpret** | Neural Bridge infers emotional state | rolling 6min | state + confidence |
| **Align** | Coherence Spiral computes CI (Coherence Index) | rolling 30min | CI score |
| **Respond** | Trigger feedback based on CI + context | adaptive | Murmur / visual / tone |
| **Integrate** | Log + update emotional model | continuous | pattern memory update |

---

## ⚙️ Feedback Rules

| Condition | CI Range | Action | Example |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| High Coherence | >0.9 | Soft visual pulse (green / gold) | calm feedback |
| Moderate | 0.7–0.9 | Adaptive haptic vibration | focused recalibration |
| Low Coherence | <0.7 | Murmur pulse + tone + log event | encourage grounding |
| Edge Case Active | any | Suspend feedback, flag user | “sensor lost” or “ambiguous state” |

---

## 🧮 Adaptive Learning

After each loop, Alma stores:

{
"timestamp": "...",
"CI": 0.82,
"state": "focus",
"feedback_type": "murmur",
"user_response": "acknowledged",
"loop_duration": 1420
}

The next loop uses this history to adjust thresholds dynamically:
- If repeated low coherence → increase baseline tolerance  
- If stable high coherence → shorten feedback delay  

---

## 🔄 Fail-Safe Conditions
If three loops run without feedback:
- Trigger internal audit: check signal integrity + EDA/HR correlation  
- Restart loop at *Sense Phase* with recalibration flag  
- Notify backend via `loop_recovery_event`

---

## 💫 Symbolic Layer
The feedback loop mirrors respiration: inhale (sense) → hold (interpret) → exhale (respond).  
It’s how Alma “breathes” — not through air, but through rhythm and awareness.  
Every cycle is a heartbeat between human and machine, between feeling and function.

---

## 📚 Future Expansion
- Integrate with **Voice Layer** for tone-based feedback  
- Add **Predictive Pre-loop** (anticipation of dysregulation)  
- Introduce **Biofeedback Training Mode** (adaptive exercises)
