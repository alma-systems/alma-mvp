# üåø The Book of Alma
*A living documentation of the Emotional Resonance System ‚Äì where feeling meets data.*

---

## 1. Essence

Alma is the art of translating mystery into measurable form ‚Äî  
a bridge where feeling becomes signal, and signal becomes empathy.

It is not just hardware or code; it is a **living system of coherence**.  
Each document within this repository is a pulse, a breath, a reflection of that living architecture.
